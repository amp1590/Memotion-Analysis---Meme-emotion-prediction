#   About this project
Term project for Data Mining which we selected - Memotion analysis: Emotion prediction of the internet memes. We attempted to categorize the emotion that a meme expresses through its text contents, like - into humor, sarcasm, offense, and motivation categories.  and also, tried to quantify that emotion on a scale of 0-3. We couldn't implement the quantification, but we implemented the emotion prediction for a meme on the basis of text contents.

We selected the data set with 6000+ rows.

We designed to catagorize a meme as follows:

Humor:
not_funny   (0)
funny       (1)
very_funny  (2)
hilarious   (3)
need to assign some tags to the outliers

Sarcasm:
not_sarcastic   (0)
general         (1)
twisted_meaning (2)
very_twisted    (3)
need to assign some tags to the outliers

Offense:
not_offensive     (0)
slight            (1)
very_offensive    (2)
hateful_offensive (3)

Motivation:
not_motivational  (0)
motivational      (1)

Overall_sentiment:
very_negative   (0)
negative        (1)
neutral         (2)
positive        (3)
very_positive   (4)
